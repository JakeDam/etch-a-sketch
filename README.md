<h1>Etch-a-Sketch</h1>

<p>A working Etch-a-Sketch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User can click and drag to draw on the Etch-a-Sketch grid</li>
  <li>Includes ability to choose any color, erase, or generate random colors</li>
  <li>The number of grid squares can be adjusted for finer or thicker drawing and gridlines can be toggled on and off</li>
  <li>The pencil shader setting will incrementally darken a square from grey to black after 10 passes of the mouse</il>
</ul>

<p>While working on this project I gained a ton of experience manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. It was also good practice for using CSS Flexbox to dynamically create the grid.</p>
